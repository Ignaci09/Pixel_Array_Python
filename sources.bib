title = "Finite-element solution of reaction-diffusion equations with advection",
abstract = "Reaction-diffusion equations arise in many chemical and biological settings. Solutions to these equations exhibit a wide variety of structures, including pattern formation and traveling waves. In groundwater aquifers, reaction-diffusion equations govern kinetic adsorption and the growth and transport of biofilm-forming microbes, and the equations may contain advective terms. Accurate simulation in these cases is crucial to the development of contaminant remediation strategies. However, advection interferes with the numerics, causing spurious oscillations or artificial diffusion near sharp fronts. These errors can trigger unrealistic reaction effects. We examine finite-element techniques for solving reaction-diffusion problems with advection. The techniques are based on the modified method of characteristics, in some cases including streamline or velocity-weighted numerical diffusion to suppress numerical oscillations. In contrast with linear reactions, nonlinear reactions may contain thresholds, and errors near these thresholds can affect the qualitative structure of solutions. Therefore, both the oscillations associated with poorly resolved, nondiffusive schemes and the smearing associated with diffusive schemes can distort the numerical solutions significantly.",

  abstract={The problem of simultaneous diffusion and creation processes, in particular self-generating mechanisms, is analysed with special regard to localization, dynamic confluence, collapse and anti-collapse. Exact solutions and central expansions for one- and multidimensional systems are developed. The analysis comprises a study of the case, where the coefficient of the self-generation source term is spatially inhomogeneous. It also introduces the concept of a dynamic equilibrium width, which may be approached in time by several interacting distributions, starting out with different initial conditions. The analysis considers various powers of nonlinearity of the diffusion coefficient as well as of the dynamic variable in the source term. Comparisons between various approaches to the problem are presented. Applications are considered in the physics of hot fusion plasmas, and occur quite generally in heat conduction with self-generating sources.}
